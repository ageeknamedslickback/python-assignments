# Python Code
# This program will calculate and display the total monthly pay for each professional barber.
# The user will be prompted for the number of haircuts in a single shift, the number of days hair cuts is serviced per month, and the amount of tips recieved for the month.
# The program will accumulate and display Shop Totals ( sum of all professional barbers)
